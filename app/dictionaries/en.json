You will not be disappointed when you visit Gleis 3 if you are ever in Interlaken. It is absolutely wonderful!",

The dining area seats maybe 24 people and many guests enjoy the cheese fondue, which can be overwhelming, but then you probably shouldn’t go into a traditional Swiss restaurant.",

Big praise goes to the owner Ritchie, who was super friendly and attentive and made sure we felt comfortable from the moment we entered the restaurant and were excellently served throughout the entire meal. Highly recommended!",
